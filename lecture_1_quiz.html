      "The number of phones roughly equals the population",
      "No data was provided on phone numbers"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "The introduction notes that there are more mobile phones than people globally【253913879556534†L15-L18】."

      "Only GPS receivers",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "The slides list motion sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers) and GPS among mobile hardware features【253913879556534†L58-L71】."
  },
  {

    "options": [
      "Application layer",
      "Operating system layer",
      "Hardware layer",
      "Database management layer"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "why": "The generic mobile architecture comprises the app, OS, hardware and app store【253913879556534†L108-L129】; a database management layer is not listed."
  },
  {
    "q": "What characterizes a native mobile application?",
    "options": [
      "It runs directly in the operating system and can access device features",
      "It is written entirely in JavaScript and runs in a browser",
      "It cannot access the camera or GPS",
      "It must be written in HTML and CSS"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "Native apps execute directly in the OS, can access device features like camera and GPS, and are typically installed via app stores【253913879556534†L184-L193】."

      "var",
      "val",
      "const",
      "let"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "The Kotlin slides explain that `var` declares a mutable variable, whereas `val` declares an immutable value【987723225263861†L24-L31】."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does Kotlin's type inference allow you to do?",
    "options": [
      "Omit explicit types when the compiler can infer them",
      "Declare variables without initializing them",
      "Infer types for null values without annotations",
      "Convert integers to strings automatically"
    ],

    "correct": 0,
    "why": "To allow null values, Kotlin uses the ? suffix (e.g., `String?`)【987723225263861†L44-L54】. Declaring without ? will not compile."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which Kotlin construct allows you to choose among multiple conditions in a concise way?",

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "The slides introduce the `when` expression, where each branch is represented by a condition【987723225263861†L79-L86】."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which statement about Kotlin functions is correct?",
    "options": [
      "Functions are declared using the `fun` keyword and can return values",

      "Functions must be anonymous",
      "Functions are declared using the `function` keyword"
    ],
    "correct": 0,

  },
  {
    "q": "What is a Kotlin lambda expression?",
    "options": [
      "A small anonymous function that can be passed as an argument",
      "A property of a class",
      "A reserved word for loops",
      "A function that must be named"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "The slides describe lambda expressions as small anonymous functions that can be assigned to variables or passed to other functions【987723225263861†L139-L150】."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following demonstrates encapsulation in Kotlin classes?",
    "options": [
      "Declaring a private property and providing controlled access via a function",
      "Using only public properties",
      "Declaring variables outside of classes",
      "Accessing all class variables directly"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "The class example keeps a doorLock property private and exposes an unlockDoor() function for controlled access, illustrating encapsulation【987723225263861†L123-L130】."
  },
  {
    "q": "What happens if you try to assign null to a non‑nullable Kotlin variable?",
    "options": [
      "Compilation fails due to null safety",
      "The value defaults to an empty string",
      "The variable becomes nullable automatically",
      "A runtime NullPointerException is thrown"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "Kotlin variables cannot hold null values by default; attempting to assign null causes a compilation error【987723225263861†L44-L54】."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which scope function allows performing operations on a nullable object only when it is non‑null?",

      "let",
      "apply",
      "with",
      "also"

    "q": "Which code snippet correctly defines a simple Kotlin function that returns a String?",
    "options": [
      "fun greet(): String { return \"Hello\" }",
      "function greet(): String { return \"Hello\" }",
      "fun greet() = 42",
      "String greet() { return \"Hello\" }"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "why": "Kotlin functions use the `fun` keyword, the return type follows the parentheses, and the body can return a String【987723225263861†L89-L100】."

      "Null always",
      "It throws an exception",
      "It returns Unit"

  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following best describes Kotlin's type inference?",
    "options": [
      "The compiler infers types based on the assigned values, allowing you to omit explicit types",

    "options": [
      "The code fails to compile because String has no inc() method",
      "It returns the next character in the alphabet",
      "It converts the string to uppercase",
      "It adds a number to the end of the string"
